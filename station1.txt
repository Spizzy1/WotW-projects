*tuning out of static* (a man in his 20’s starts speaking) Hello, im reporting from the local university with important information regarding developments in biological science! We have developed a sort of chemical that tastes sweet like sugar but is healthy like sallad. Truly a life changing discovery if i’ve ever heard of one! Another news is that the meteor that crashed into grovers mill this morning has been identified as an alien object, it currently seems harmless and we have scientists near the crash site with more information that will be broadcasted to us live. Now for the new chemical AsUS is steamrolling the competition in the weight loss and sweetener business. Its truly remarkable how quickly it arose to the top when it comes to sweeteners to use in heavy fat food items. We have yet to have an individual come out claiming their discovery of the chemical mixture however the 3 biggest american pharmaceutical companies are really fighting to get their patent on it first. That's all for the “AsUS SWEEP” as the stock market refers to it. Now onto the Alien object that landed in Grovers mill.

*tunic out of static* (a man in his 30’s with a very frantic voice starts speaking) Hello i'm Professor Carl reporting from grovers mill about the alien object that has landed. The zone is currently being closed off by a bunch of policeman trying to get civilians out of the area and to safety. Many civilians are scared but curious as the origins of the object is still unknown apart from it arriving from space. We have yet to see if it contains any lifeforms or if it even poses any danger to us people around. Not much is currently happening so im gonna start heading back to the university, but you’re gonna wanna be alert the coming days for any news regarding it. Back to you professor.

§Hello, im reporting from the local university with important information regarding developments with the alien object in Grovers mill. Recent developments show that the object seems to be producing a low resonating frequency that is disturbing communications. It’s also worth mentioning that the police and government are on high alert regarding the object and there is no reason to fear the situation escalating to endanger the local population. Regarding the obvious pattern between this and the explosions on mars we cannot find any patterns and are unsure if they are connected in any way. Now for our morning guest to talk a bit about their recent developments
*the mic quality shifts drastically and becomes difficult to understand* Hello students of the university, As many of you may know i am Percy Spencer the inventor of the microwave. Many may know it as the Compact oven or the quick heater. Its become widely popularized and has caused the divorces of many married couples due to the man no longer needing his wife. However amazing the invention may seem its also important to note that i didn't just wake up and create it out of nowhere. No, it took years of nagging from my wife for me to finally decide to outcompete her with my great mind and love for electronics. Now all you little scientists may think to yourself “well i don't have an annoying wife or a great mind”. But thats the amazing thing about science, anyone can do it. As long as you are aware of the inner workings of what you are creating everything is possible! And thats why you should listen to your teachers, Because they will tell you all about whats important in these mechanical and biological discoveries.
*the mic quality shifts back to being easier to understand* Welcome back to the university, we will be linking you straight back to grovers mill with urgent information *static* 
*tunic out of static* (a man in his 30’s with a very frantic voice starts speaking) Hello i'm Professor Carl reporting from grovers mill about the alien object that has landed. The object has started moving and is showing signs of life and movement. All the nearby civilians are currently being slowly evacuated while we attempt to understand whats going on with the object,So far there shouldn't be too much to worry about if you are at home. But we would recommend to stay inside and listen to all broadcasts regarding this situation for the next hour or so. The object has started to rise out of the ground, It seems to have grown some sort of legs and is slowly creeping towards the policeman around it. Its opening something that looks quite like an eye and is looking around? I- I dont know whats going. There was a bright red light and the policeman seem to have disappeared. Everyone is freaking out and panicking-. Im gonna start trying to run but i-*the broadcast suddenly cuts off*
