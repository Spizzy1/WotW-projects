*tuning out of static* (a man around his 30’s starts speaking excitedly) Hello wildlings, Im your host Bill and on todays episode of bills survival guide we have bring news regarding tomorrows broadcast and a wildlife report from our local hunter: Tim! we have ordered the “survivalists box of essentials” from BearNecessity. And it should arrive by tomorrow morning, so be tuned in for next episode. I have very high expectations as BearNecessity have a large catalog of wonderful tools and gadgets to help you survive the harsh conditions of the wilderness. Im hoping that it lives up to the expectations and that it will be a worthy contribution to my survival collection. Anyways while we await and prepare for tomorrows broadcast i hand you over to Tim for the wildlife report.

(a more young voice starts speaking) Hello, Its Tim here on the local wildlife report. Due to the recent earthquakes and cometfall animals are on the move and very easily scared. I would recommend all of the hunters out there to bring your best stealth gear and calm down your nerves because all wildlife is on edge from the recent events and even the slightest sound might scare away your dinner. Aside from that i would recommend rabbit today as it can be cooked very nicely with the seasons vegetables and without using too much energy can be made into a killer stew.
Back to Bill’s Survival Guide.

Thanks Tim for that valuable info. Hello wildlings its me again, Bill. I think we are running out of time for todays broadcast so we will end it here for today. 
§Hello wildlings, Im your host Bill and on todays episode of bills Survival we will be opening the highly anticipated “survivalists box of essentials” from BearNecessity.
*sounds of cardboard boxes being moved and something heavy being placed on a table*
I will first try to carve a piece of bark while using the knife to check on the sharpness and general durability. *slight woodcutting noises* It works like a charm! BearNecessity have truly increased their standards since their last knife that dulled after just a few cuts. Now onto the flint and steel. *a chair gets dragged along the floor* I will try to follow the pamphlet as closely as possible to check how good the instructions are. *sounds of small pieces of wood moving around and then a piece of rock hitting a piece of metal* And we have fire! It truly works wonderfully and the instructions are clear and easy to follow! It truly makes me happy to see more people having good options for tools like these to help them in the wilderness.
Now onto the last item…. THE RADIO! *sounds of slight movement* Now i doubt that most of the people listening don't own a personal radio, however this one can fit in your hand and can pick up broadcast from over a mile away! Im gonna try and find some local broadcasts and then water test it. *sounds of static coming from the mic and something mechanical being turned* i think that should be it- *sounds of music start coming from the radio* It truly does work wonderfully! now to test it in the water! Ive prepared a small plate with water to gently dip it into. *sounds of static* OUCH- The little bugger shocked me-. Well i’ve gotta see if it still works anyways. *sounds of static* it seems to be broken, and i barely had time to dip it into the water before it shocked me…. Ive gotta say that the kit has value but the radio may not hold up so well in the wilderness. I’d rate the kit a solid 4/5 stars, it has its flaws but the knife, flint and pamphlet truly do help you with making fire. Thats it for todays broadcast.
§*tuning out of static* Hello wildlings, Im your host Bill and on todays episode of bills survival guide we are going to have a relatively short episode as our lovely Tim unfortunately got food poisoning therefore cannot do a wildlife report. He says he will be available for tomorrows episode but its unclear. Hopefully he tunes into this episode as we are going to talk about how to make sure your wild meat is prepared well! So, lets get right into it. 
*the sound gets a bit unclear as the man picks up the microphone and moves it towards the kitchen* Welcome back everyone, Im going to narrate as i cook this wild caught meat and explain the process to you. *the sizzling sound of meat on a pan begins* First of all you wanna make sure you don't put too much meat on the pan and that if its larger you cut it into smaller pieces to heat it all up evenly. Its important to remember to move the meat so that it doesn't stick to the pan. Depending on the type of meat you use you’re gonna wanna be more precise to make sure its all cooked, However i am using horse today so we should be mostly fine. You want to pay attention to the color of the meat and use a thermometer to regularly check the temperature. Many people like to eat the meat slightly undercooked or raw but then its very important to know that its safe first, I do not condone taking unnecessary risks at any point during your daily life. (The voice gets strained) We do not take responsibility if any of our recommended products fail or you fail to follow our instructions.
(the voice calms down a bit but is noticeably frustrated) Sorry got a bit carried away, but recent law forces me to say stuff like that and its starting to get on my nerves. Im gonna be ending todays broadcast even earlier than intended because im too frustrated to keep calm. Im sorry wildlings but i’ll see you tomorrow. *static*
